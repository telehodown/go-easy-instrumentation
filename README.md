# Go Agent Assisted Instrumentation
Go is a compiled language with an opaque runtime, making it unable to support automatic instrumentation the way other languages are, which is why the New Relic Go Agent is designed as an SDK. That makes installing and getting the most out of the Go Agent something that requires much more upfront investment than other language agents. To address this, the Go Agent team created the Go Agent Assisted Instrumentation tool, which will do most of the instrumentation work for you by generating changes to your source code that instruments your application with the New Relic Go Agent.

## Limited Preview Notice
This is a limited preview of the Assisted Instrumentation product. As such, it is still under active development. We appreciate any feedback you may have about any issues you find as you explore this tool.

The scope of what this tool can instrument in your application is limited to the listed features:
 - Capturing errors in any function wrapped or traced by a transaction
 - Tracing locally defined functions that are invoked in the application's main() method with a transaction
 - Tracing async functions and function literals with an async segment
 - Wrapping HTTP handlers
 - Injecting distributed tracing into external traffic

**ONLY** the following Go packages and libraries are supported right now:
  - standard library
  - net/http

Regardless of the scope, this tool will not interfere with your application's operation, so it doesn't make any changes to your code directly. Instead, it analyzes your source code, identifies opportunities to instrument it, then suggests changes to your code that use the New Relic Go Agent SDK to capture telemetry data. These additions will be in the form of a `.diff` file, which you should review before applying to your source code.

As part of the analysis, this tool may invoke `go get` or other Go language toolchain commands which may modify your `go.mod` file, but not your actual source code.

**Note** that this tool can not detect if you already have new relic instrumentation. Please only use this on applications without any instrumentation.

## Installation
Please have a version of Go installed that is within the support window for the current [Go programming language lifecycle](https://endoflife.date/go).
1. Clone this repository to a directory on your system. For example: `git clone .../go-agent-pre-instrumentation`
2. Go into that directory: `cd go-agent-pre-instrumentation`
3. Resolve any third-party dependencies: `go mod tidy`

## Getting Started
This tool works best when used with git. It's a best practice to ensure that your application is on a branch without any unstaged changes before applying any of the generated changes to it. After checking that, follow these steps to generate and apply the changes that install the New Relic Go Agent in an application:

1. Go to parser directory: ```cd parser```
2. Run the CLI tool: ```go run . -path ../my-application/``.  This will create a file named `new-relic-instrumentation.diff` in your working directory
3. Please verify, and correct the contents of the `diff` file
4. Apply the changes
  ```sh
  mv new-relic-instrumentation.diff ../my-application/
  cd ../my-application
  git apply new-relic-instrumentation.diff
  ```

Once the changes are applied, the application should run with the New Relic Go Agent installed. If the agent installation is not working the way you want it to, the changes can easily be undone using git tools by either stashing them with `git stash` or reverting the code to a previous commit.

## Support
This is an experimental product, and New Relic is not offering official support at the moment. Please create issues in github if you are encountering a problem that you're unable to resolve. When creating issues, its vital to include as much of the prompted for information as possible. This enables us to get to the root cause of the issue much more quickly. Please also make sure to search existing issues before creating a new one.
